See our [Quick Start Guide](http://github.com/ensime/ensime-server/wiki/Quick-Start-Guide) to learn how to install and start ENSIME.

Report issues on the [ensime-server tracker](https://github.com/ensime/ensime-server/issues) after checking the [FAQs](https://github.com/ensime/ensime-server/issues?q=label%3AFAQ) and ensuring that you're using the latest version of the ensime mode. Stacktraces are useful: enable `(setq debug-on-error t)` and re-attempt what you were doing.
